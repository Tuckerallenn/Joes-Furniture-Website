# Joes-Furniture-Website

This project is created to participate in the DevCatalyst project. The project was created by Tucker Allen. I created it in about a month, and worked on it primarily by myself.

The website is fully functional and is created to promote the fantasy buisness of "Joes Furniture" that was created 66 years ago by Joe Spain in Nashville, TN.
