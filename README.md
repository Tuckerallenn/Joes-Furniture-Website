# Joes-Furniture-Website

This project is created to participate in the DevCatalyst project. The project was created by Tucker Allen. I am a Junior at Chester County High School.I created it in about a month, and worked on it primarily by myself.

The website is fully functional and is created to promote the fantasy buisness of "Joes Furniture" that was created 66 years ago by Joe Spain in Nashville, TN.

I hope you enjoy this fun little website that was very enjoyable to make. :)
